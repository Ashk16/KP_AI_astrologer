- Swiss Ephemeris integration for accurate planetary calculations
- Multi-house significator analysis with weighted scoring
- Advanced timeline generation (Star Lord + Sub Lord levels)

### 📊 **Dashboard Features**
- **Asc/Desc Terminology**: Clean astrological interface (Team 1 = Asc, Team 2 = Desc)
- **Multi-layered Timeline Analysis**: 
  - Aggregated timeline (NL+SL) for practical analysis
  - Granular timeline (SSL) for precise timing
- **Enhanced Muhurta Analysis**: Comprehensive match predictions
- **Color-coded Verdicts**: Visual indication of favorable/unfavorable periods

### 🎨 **UI/UX Improvements**
- Horizontal scrolling for comment visibility
- Professional CSS styling with custom scrollbars
- Responsive dataframe display
- Enhanced verdict pattern recognition

### 💾 **Match Archive System**
- Automatic match data saving to JSON format
- Historical analysis retrieval
- Complete planetary and timeline data preservation

## 📈 **PREDICTION ACCURACY STATUS**

### ✅ **Working Correctly**
- Basic KP significator analysis
- Timeline verdict generation  
- Muhurta analysis and synthesis
- Most planetary period predictions
- House-based scoring system

### ⚠️ **Known Issues** 
- **Saturn Debilitation Case**: Saturn in Aries giving positive results despite negative significators
  - Identified as classical Neecha Bhanga scenario
  - Requires debilitation framework implementation
  - Does not affect other planetary predictions

## 🔄 **ROLLBACK INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Method 1: Using Batch Script (Recommended)**
```bash
# Double-click the rollback script
./rollback_to_stable.bat
```

### **Method 2: Manual Git Commands**
```bash
# Rollback to stable tag
git checkout v1.0-stable-june30

# Create new branch for safety
git checkout -b rollback-to-stable  

# Force reset main to stable (CAUTION: Loses all changes)
git checkout main
git reset --hard v1.0-stable-june30
```

### **Method 3: Fresh Clone from Stable Tag**
```bash
# Clone specific stable version
git clone --branch v1.0-stable-june30 <your-repo-url> kp-astrologer-stable
```

## 🚀 **PLANNED ENHANCEMENTS** (Next Phase)

### 🔥 **Classical Debilitation Framework**
- Neecha Bhanga (Debilitation Cancellation) detection
- Neecha Bhanga Raja Yoga identification  
- Dignity-based planetary scoring
- Sign lord agency calculations
- Degree-specific debilitation effects

### ⚡ **Advanced KP Rules**
- 8th house transformation principles
- Mixed significator resolution logic
- Temporal debilitation effects
- Enhanced planetary strength calculations

## 📝 **DEVELOPMENT NOTES**

### **Safe Implementation Strategy**
1. Always test on copies of match archive data
2. Implement debilitation rules incrementally
3. Compare results with stable version predictions
4. Only replace stable after thorough validation

### **Critical Files for Debilitation Implementation**
- `kp_core/analysis_engine.py` - Core scoring logic
- `kp_core/planet_calculations.py` - Planetary dignity
- `kp_core/significator_engine.py` - House analysis

### **Validation Datasets**
- `match_archive/2025-06-29_dind_vs_tri.json` - Saturn debilitation case
- `match_archive/2025-06-24_Wiz_vs_sma.json` - Score validation reference
- `match_archive/2025-06-27_Lei_vs_Nor.json` - General accuracy baseline

## 🛡️ **STABILITY GUARANTEE**

This stable version has been extensively tested and provides:
- ✅ Reliable basic KP predictions
- ✅ Consistent timeline analysis  
- ✅ Stable dashboard functionality
- ✅ Complete match archiving
- ✅ Safe fallback point for development

**Use this version for production until debilitation framework is fully validated.**
